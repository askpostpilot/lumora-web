# DevOps Setup Completion

This document summarizes the DevOps setup completed for the Lumora + n8n deployment.

## Environment File Created

A `.env` file was created in the root directory with the following configuration:
```
N8N_PORT=5678
GENERIC_TIMEZONE=Asia/Kolkata
TZ=Asia/Kolkata
N8N_PAYLOAD_SIZE_MAX=64
N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<48-character base64 key generated>
N8N_HOST=localhost
DOMAIN=localhost
LE_EMAIL=ask.promptwise@gmail.com
```

## Container Deployment

Successfully deployed the following containers using `docker compose up -d`:
- **traefik**: Reverse proxy and SSL termination (ports 80, 443)
- **lumora-web**: Static website (port 80)
- **n8n**: Workflow automation platform (port 5678)
- **watchtower**: Container auto-updater

## Backup System

### Backup Script
Created `n8n_backup.sh` with the following features:
- Backs up n8n data volume using Docker
- Includes docker-compose.yml and .env files
- Compresses using tar with gzip
- Stores backups in `/var/backups/n8n/`
- Maintains 14-day retention (automatic cleanup)

### Cron Job
Added to crontab for daily execution:
```
0 2 * * * /home/runner/work/lumora-web/lumora-web/n8n_backup.sh >> /var/log/n8n_backup.log 2>&1
```

## Access Information

- **n8n Interface**: http://SERVER_IP:5678
- **Lumora Website**: http://SERVER_IP
- **Traefik Dashboard**: http://SERVER_IP (if enabled)

## Status Verification

Use the included `deployment_status.sh` script to check:
- Container health and status
- Backup configuration
- Access URLs
- Environment settings

## Files Added

1. `n8n_backup.sh` - Daily backup script
2. `deployment_status.sh` - Status reporting script
3. `.env` - Environment configuration (not committed to git)

All requirements from the original DevOps task have been successfully implemented and tested.
