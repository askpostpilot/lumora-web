# IP Detection Updates Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to replace hardcoded IP addresses with dynamic IP detection.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Script: `fix-port-conflict.sh`
- Implements the complete port conflict resolution and stack restart functionality
- Uses `SERVER_IP=$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')` for dynamic IP detection
- Replaces `YOUR_SERVER_IP` placeholders with actual detected IP in output

### 2. Updated Deployment Scripts

#### `deployment/n8n-deploy.sh`:
- Line 9: Changed `VPS_IP="147.79.68.121"` to `VPS_IP="${VPS_IP:-$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')}"` 
- Lines 158, 176: Replaced hardcoded URLs with dynamic IP detection

#### `deployment/n8n-deploy-local.sh`:
- Lines 153, 172, 175: Replaced hardcoded IP with dynamic detection for access URLs

#### `scripts/deploy-https.sh`:
- Line 55: Changed `EXPECTED_IP="147.79.68.121"` to dynamic detection for DNS validation

### 3. Updated Documentation Files

#### `deployment/QUICK_DEPLOY.md`:
- Replaced all instances of `147.79.68.121` with `YOUR_SERVER_IP`

#### `deployment/README.md`:
- Replaced all instances of `147.79.68.121` with `YOUR_SERVER_IP`

#### `deployment/MANUAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md`:
- Replaced all instances of `147.79.68.121` with `YOUR_SERVER_IP`

#### `DEPLOYMENT.md`:
- Updated domain name reference from hardcoded IP to placeholder

#### `DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md`:
- Updated VPS IP reference to use placeholder

## Testing

All modified scripts pass syntax validation:
- `fix-port-conflict.sh` ✅
- `deployment/n8n-deploy.sh` ✅  
- `deployment/n8n-deploy-local.sh` ✅
- `scripts/deploy-https.sh` ✅

IP detection functionality tested and working:
- Command: `hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'`
- Returns valid IP address on the current system

## Benefits

1. **Dynamic IP Detection**: Scripts now automatically detect the server's IP address
2. **Portability**: No need to hardcode specific IP addresses in scripts
3. **Documentation Clarity**: Uses `YOUR_SERVER_IP` placeholder for better user understanding
4. **Consistent Pattern**: All scripts now use the same IP detection method used elsewhere in the codebase

## Impact

- Scripts will work on any VPS without manual IP address configuration
- Documentation is more generic and applicable to any deployment
- Maintains backward compatibility while adding flexibility
- Follows the existing patterns already used in `verify-deployment.sh` and other scripts
